## HWO-2014 Clojure bot for my Talk at ClojureD 2015

I'll need an own botkey to run it, sorry (put it into src/hwo2014bot/config.clj and config).
Then it will work with the build/run script or the start-race function in core.clj.

You can find slides along with the videos a playlist and a transcript of the over [here] (http://drowsy.de/download/ClojureD15.zip).
Beware of typos and grammar errors in the transcript!

The source for the competing bot can also be found on my github [here] (https://github.com/IamDrowsy/hwo2014).
